                    <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
                    <p>
                        We believe local bookstores are essential community hubs that foster culture, curiosity, and a love of reading, and we're committed to helping them thrive.<br>
                        Every purchase on the site financially supports independent bookstores.<br>
                        Our platform gives independent bookstores tools to compete online and financial support to help them maintain their presence in local communities<br><br>
                        Bookshop.org began as an idea to help support bookstores and their communities as more and more people are buying their books online. <br>
                        We saw an opportunity to create an alternative to Amazon for socially-conscious online shoppers. Amazon sells over 60% of all books in the US and is growing. <br>
                        That shift threatens the future of bookstores and will hurt readers, authors, and publishers who rely on a diverse, healthy ecosystem for books.<br><br>
                        As the COVID-19 pandemic surged, our growing platform helped our community of independent booksellers survive shutdowns. That spring, traffic to Bookshop.org <br>
                        hit 1 million users in a single day. By the end of 2020 we had grown to over 1,000 bookstores and distributed over ten million dollars in profits.
